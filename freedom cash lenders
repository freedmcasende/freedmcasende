Medical school can be very costly, and Sallie Mae offers loans to help cover your tuition and fees. While its medical school loans have fairly competitive rates, loan amounts and terms aren’t mentioned on Sallie Mae’s site.  

Those seeking financial aid to pay for dental school could get a loan from Sallie Mae. Similar to medical school loans, Sallie Mae doesn’t offer insight into loan amounts or terms for dental school loans on its website.  

In addition to its undergraduate, graduate, and professional loans, Sallie Mae also provides technical school loans with even more competitive rates (as of publication). These loans can help offset the cost of technical or trade school.
